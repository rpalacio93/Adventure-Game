# Adventure Game
Udacity's "Adventure Game" Project.

An adventure game where your decisions matter! Buy a weapon, upgrade, and defeat the dragon!
The goal is to get what you can before 8:00 PM to defeat the dragon.

Using the on-screen instructions, input your decisions:
- The Gambler's hall, test your luck! Get up to three times of the money you bet! Or you can also lose it all... Good luck!
- Look for work, and get a steady amount of money.
- The Blacksmith to either create your sword or upgrade if you already have one! Necessary to defeat the dragon.
- Go back to your hometown to confront the dragon!
